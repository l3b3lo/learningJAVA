1. Vectors are a data structure with a contiguous block of memory, just like an array.
2. Becaouse memory locations are contiguous, they can be randomly accessed so that the 
	access time of an element of the vector is constant.
3. Storag is managed automatically soo that on an attempt to insert an element into a 
   full vector, a larger memory block is allocated for the vector, the vector elements 
   are copied to the new block, and trhe old one is released. 
4. Vectors are thus flexible array, in that, an array whose size can be dynamically changed.
